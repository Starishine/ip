AI Tools Used:

ChatGPT: Used to assist in writing JUnit test cases.

Usage Log:
Week 5:

Tools Used: ChatGPT

Tasks:

Used ChatGPT to generate extra JUnit test cases for the TaskManager, Event, and Deadline classes.

Observations:

ChatGPT provided quick and accurate JUnit test skeletons, saving significant time on writing repetitive test cases.

The generated tests required minimal modifications and were mostly aligned with the expected functionality.

Overall Impact:

Time Saved: Estimated time saved is around 50% for writing unit tests, as the skeleton of the code was auto-generated.

What Worked: ChatGPT generated comprehensive test cases with assertions for edge cases and typical scenarios.

What Didnâ€™t Work: None, as the generated tests were suitable with minor tweaks.

Next Steps:

Continue using AI to assist with writing additional tests for other parts of the project if needed.
